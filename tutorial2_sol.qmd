We are going to dig into into the seminal model of growth theory in macroeconomics: the Solow model.

## Quick model summary

1.  **Structure of the economy**: firms and consumers (no state). Firms use (and pay) capital and labor to produce an output. Output (=income) is either consumed or saved by households:

    $$ Y_t = C_t + I_t $$

2.  **Production Function**: a representative firm produces output using a Cobb-Douglas production function: $$ Y_t = F(K_t, A_tL_t) =  K_t^\alpha (A_tL_t)^{1-\alpha}$$ where $Y$ is output, $K$ is capital, $L$ is labor and $A$ is technology. where $0 < \alpha < 1$. Using capital comes at rental price $r$ and labor comes at price $w$ (the wage).

3.  **Capital accumulation:** capital accumulates through savings and depreciates geometrically

    $$ K_{t+1} = I_t + (1-\delta) K_t$$

<!-- -->

1.  **Saving rate:** investment is a constant fraction of output

    $$ I_{t} = sF(K_t,A_tL_t)$$

## Definitions

1.  **Steady state:** trajectory where all variables are constant
2.  **Balanced growth path:** trajectory such that per capita variables grow at a constant rate (not necessarily the same) and the capital to output ratio is constant

## Exercise

### 1. Warm-up: Returns to scale

Let $\lambda > 1$, if $F(\lambda X, \lambda Y) < \lambda F(X,Y)$, the function has decreasing returns to scale (and increasing for $>$). If $F(\lambda X, \lambda Y) = \lambda F(X,Y)$, the function has constant returns to scale. For the following functions, state if they exhibit positive, constant, or negative returns to scale.

1.  $y_1 = 10x^2y^2$

$$
y_1(\lambda x, \lambda y) = \lambda^4 y_1(x,y) > \lambda y_1(x,y)  \text{ , increasing returns to scale}
$$

2.  $y_2 = \frac{1}{2}x^{1/3}y^{1/2}$

$$
y_2(\lambda x, \lambda y) = \lambda^{5/6} y_2(x,y) < \lambda y_2(x,y)  \text{ , decreasing returns to scale}
$$

3.  $y_3 = x + 2y$

$$
y_3(\lambda x, \lambda y) = \lambda y_3(x,y) = \lambda y_2(x,y)  \text{ , constant returns to scale}
$$

4.  $y_4 = \ln(xy), x>1,y>1$

$$
y_4(\lambda x, \lambda y) = 2\ln(\lambda) + y_4(x,y)
$$

Depends on initial level. Fix $\lambda = e$ so that $2\ln(\lambda) =2$)

For $xy = e$, $y_4(\lambda x, \lambda y) = 3 > \lambda y_4(x,y)$

For $xy = e^3$, $y_4(\lambda x, \lambda y) = 5 < \lambda y_4(x,y)$

### 2. Solve the firm's maximization problem

Consider the function above ($Y_t =  K_t^{\alpha} (A_tL_t)^{1-\alpha}$).

1.  Show that if $K=0$ and/or $L=0$ production does not occur

Immediate

2.  Show that the production function has constant returns to scale

$$
F(\lambda K_t, \lambda L_t) = \lambda K_t^{\alpha} (A_tL_t)^{1-\alpha} = F(K,L)
$$

3.  Show that marginal productivity is positive for capital and labour

$$
F_K(K_t,L_t) = \alpha  K_t^{\alpha-1} (A_tL_t)^{1-\alpha} >0
$$

$$
F_L(K_t,L_t) = (1-\alpha)  K_t^{\alpha} (A_t)^{1-\alpha} L_t^{-\alpha} >0
$$

4.  Show that marginal productivity is decreasing for capital and labour

$$
F_{KK}(K_t,L_t) = \alpha (\alpha-1) K_t^{\alpha-2} (A_tL_t)^{1-\alpha} <0
$$

$$
F_{LL}(K_t,L_t) = (1-\alpha) (-\alpha)  K_t^{\alpha} (A_t)^{1-\alpha} L_t^{-\alpha-1} <0
$$

5.  Write the down the profit maximization program (maximizing profit with respect to K and L) and derive its first order conditions

$$
\max_{K,L} Y_t - rK_t - wL_t
$$

FOC with respect to K implies: $F_K(K_t,L_t) = \frac{dF}{dK} = r$

FOC with respect to L implies: $F_L(K_t,L_t)=\frac{dF}{dL} = w$

6.  Show that all output is needed to pay capital and labor

Differentiating both sides of the constant return to scale equation with respect to $\lambda$ yields:

$$
F_{K}(\lambda K_t,\lambda L_t)K_t +F_{L}(\lambda K_t,\lambda L_t)L_t  = F(K_t,L_t) 
$$

Evaluating it at $\lambda = 1$ (constant returns to scale is true whatever $\lambda$ and in particular for $\lambda = 1$) and and plugging the results of the two FOC of the profit maximization problem yields the result.

### 3. Constant population and technology

For now, we consider that technology and labor (=population) are constant ($A_t = A$, $L_t = L$): no population growth, no technological progress.

1.  Using the capital accumulation equation, show that the ratio $\frac{K_{t+1}}{K_t}$ goes to $\infty$ as $K_t$ goes to 0 and is lower than 1 when $K_t$ goes to $\infty$

$$
g(K_t) = \frac{K_{t+1}}{K_t} = s \left(\frac{A_tL_t}{K_t}\right)^{1-\alpha} + 1-\delta
$$

It tends to $+\infty$ as $K_t \rightarrow 0^+$, and $0^+$ as $K_t \rightarrow +\infty$

2.  Show that there is a unique steady state level of capital $k^*$ and solve for it

Plugging $K = K_{t+1} = K_t$ and solving for it in the equation above yields:

$$
k^* = AL \left(\frac{s}{\delta}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\alpha}}
$$

3.  How does the $k^*$ vary with $s$, $\delta$, $A$, $L$ ? Interpret

Capital accumulation is facilitated by a high saving rate $s$ , a low depreciation rate $\delta$ and by high levels of effective labor $AL$ (additional units of capital are highly productive up to a higher level of $K$ )

### 4. Population and technology growth

We now assume that population grows at constant rate $n$, and technology at rate $g$:

$$L_{t+1} = (1+n) L_t$$

$$A_{t+1} = (1+g) A_t$$

We respectively denote $y_t=Y_t/L_t$ and $k_t=K_t/L_t$, the per-worker production and capital

We further define $\hat{y_t}=\frac{Y_t}{A_t L_t}$ and $\hat{k_t}=\frac{K_t}{A_tL_t}$ the production and capital per ***effective unit***

1.  Dividing the capital accumulation equation by $A_tL_t$, show that

    $$\hat{k_{t+1}} (1+n)(1+g)= (1-\delta)\hat{k_t} + s F(\frac{K_t}{A_tL_t},1)$$

Dividing the capital accumulation by $A_tL_t$ yields:

$$
\frac{K_{t+1}}{A_tL_t}= (1-\delta)\hat{k_t} + s \frac{F(K_t,A_tL_t)}{A_tL_t}
$$

Noticing that the left hand side is $\frac{K_{t+1}}{A_{t+1}L_{t+1}} (1+n)(1+g)$ and that $\frac{1}{A_tL_t}F(K_t,A_tL_t) = F(\frac{K_t}{A_tL_t},1) = F(\hat{k}_t,1)$ because of constant returns to scale yields the result.

1.  Show that there is a steady state level of capital per effective unit $\hat{k^*}$ equal to:

$$
\hat{k^*} = \left(\frac{s}{(1+n)(1+g)-1+\delta}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\alpha}}
$$

Plugging $\hat{k} = \hat{k}_{t+1} = \hat{k}_t$ and solving for it in the equation above yields the result.

Noticing that $\hat{y} = \hat{k}^\alpha$ and plugging $\hat{k}^*$ yields steady state per effective unit output:

$$
\hat{y^*} = \left(\frac{s}{(1+n)(1+g)-1+\delta}\right)^{\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}}
$$

3.  Show that per capita outcomes $y$ and $k$ are on a balanced growth path. What is their respective growth rates?

$k_t = A_t \hat{k}_t$ and $y_t = A_t \hat{y}_t$. Plugging steady state levels of $\hat{k}^*$ and $\hat{y}^*$, then computing the equilibrium growth rate of capital and output yields:

$$
\frac{k_{t+1}}{k_t} = \frac{y_{t+1}}{y_t} = (1+g)
$$

### 5. Discussion

1.  What makes this model a simplification of reality?
2.  Why cannot it explain all differences in output growth and per capita level across economies?

**Firms**:

-   Imperfect competition and appropriated innovation (through patents) yields profits and investment into private R&D

-   Heterogeneous firms/sectors need various "qualities" of physical and human capital, and different "vintages" of technology (a technology can get outdated)

**Households**:

-   Optimize and decide endogenously upon their labor supply, saving rate, fertility, education level (human capital)

**State**:

-   affects available consumption through taxes and transfers

-   affects investment into public research and public education (technological progress and human capital)

-   provides institutions that affect firms' and households' decisions

**Trade (open economy):**

-   Affects net investment in the country, and available output for consumption through imports/exports
